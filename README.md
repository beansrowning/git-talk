## Okay, how do I see this thing?

View on [Github pages!](https://beansrowning.github.io/git-talk)

## How can I build it locally?  

From R or RStudio render the RMarkdown document and bingo-boingo.  

```r
rmarkdown::render("Rmd/git_presentation.Rmd")
```  

## How can I save this to PDF?  

The best way would be to print the HTML document to a PDF using google chrome.  

Simply Ctrl+P when displaying the slides in Chrome, and change the destination as `Save as PDF`
